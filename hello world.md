Starting to learn version control system

OK, we've got a 2-nd lesson just now.

So, this is cool!


Now we're starting training for branches in git
There is MASTER branch 

Are we in a "bypass_1" branch?
Yes! We are!!! 
Now we're checking a collision
Providing a collision string 1
Providing a collision string 2


## branch bypass_2
Well,  there is the second branch for training and testing
Let us see what will be happened...
this string will generate a collision with branch bypass_3

## bypass 4
Just a line without collision

## now in bypass_5
no collision here again
